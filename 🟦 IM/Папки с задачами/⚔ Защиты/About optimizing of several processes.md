I need to optimize three processes, it is:
- Fitness routines;
- Learning and education;
- Traveling.

Let's start from:

**Fitness routines**
How can I optimize this sequence of actions which even is not process? It is easy, follow my mind!
For example I working hard on every training but I'm still fat. Why? Because I don't pay attention to statistics. 
Well, to getting results I need:
1. Create a program of daily training.
2. Following this program.
3. Record your current training results.
4. Doing analytics in the end of every week.
5. Rewrite new practices into old program

**Education process**
Here we are have to optimize something what do not have even sequence of repeated actions. How can we optimize it?
Thanks for God we are living in 21st century and we are have the Chat-GPT. 
Well, to do it we need to ask it about creating the roadmap of our staff which we want to learn. After it we need to integrate this actions into our calendar and follow if.
Also we need to record our progress and doing analytics and review of studied staff in every weekend.

**Traveling**
This is really hard to do...
I want to optimize it by one interesting action. I want to pay all my attention only for this task for a couple of days and write a bot which will research all of the places which I have an possibilities to go.
