**Setting Goals and Objectives:** A good conference strategy includes activity goals like networking with attendees, attending a keynote or workshop, and connecting with a keynote speaker or organizers. You can also aim to explore an exhibition or follow the agenda closely to ensure you gain valuable insights and engage effectively.

**Defining Expectations and Workflows:** Decide how the team will host or attend the event, including wearing coordinated attire and organizing tasks such as managing AV needs, setting up a booth, or handling a venue. Ensure everyone knows when to take a break, how to collect leads, and how to optimize turnout for the workshop or sessions being held.

**Be Memorable and Stand Out:** To increase your impact at a conference, align your efforts with the agenda and explore creative strategies such as wearing branded outfits, leveraging a booth, or using QR codes to engage attendees. Networking is essential—connect with organizers, a keynote speaker, or attendees at an exhibition to maximize turnout. Reflect on past strategies and consider how new approaches can be implemented at the next venue where the event will be held. Make time for conversations, even during a break, to foster unexpected opportunities.

**Understand Your Audience:** Focus on who will attend and their roles—whether they are budget owners, decision-makers, or influencers. Engage with attendees during a workshop, keynote, or in other spaces like an AV session or booth. Research prior events and identify how these roles align with organizational goals. If possible, obtain attendee lists from previous conferences to ensure your efforts align with the expected turnout and create meaningful interactions.
