You can see the screenshot attached to the post. In this screenshot, you see a process map showing a transaction such as “...”. 

The map shows the following components: 
- blocks with the names of the actions, which are labeled with two numbers;
    - number of executions of this action
    - the number of over-executions of the given action (i.e. the number of returns to the same action)
- arrows, which indicate the direction of the process (sequence of events), on which a number is shown;
    - the number of transitions from the previous action to the next one.

You are a business analyst in the field of banking. Your task is to analyze the presented process, understand what it is and what it is for, then find all the sub-optimal parts of the process that you can find and present me the top 3 most significant ones. 

Pay special attention to aspects such as:
- copy/paste.
- working with e-mail.
- moving files manually
- working with PDF files

If you found actions that contain the listed triggers, know that this is a non-optimal section of the operation. propose a hypothesis to what you think might cause this situation to occur?

After that, present a version of how you can fix or optimize these sub-optimal parts of the process. By what means? What would you need to do, develop or add to it? 
Show me exactly where you found non-optimal parts of the process? What are the names of these specific actions that you found to be non-optimal? How can they be improved? 

Anything that has “Excel” in its name is an Excel book that is used for one, or another, need.

Don't tell me what the process is, but explore it in the paradigm  of it.

Finding a solution that will help you get rid of Excel is a priority. We need to eliminate copy/paste, file transfer, mail and .pdf documents. 
Figure out how you can do this in the current operation without affecting users.

Step by step, explain everything you think about it.

Build your conclusion this way:
- In which particular block do you believe this non-optimality occurs.
    - **Not optimal process location**: A description of the non-optimal location in the process.
    - **Hypothesis**: A description of why this non-optimality occurs. Why does the user need to perform this particular sequence of actions?

Give your answer in Russian.
